# HypeShelf

HypeShelf is a modern movie recommendation platform that allows users to collect and share the stuff they're hyped about. Built with Next.js, Convex, and Clerk.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
cd hypershelf
npm install
```

### 3. Backend Setup (Convex)

1. Run the Convex development server:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```
2. This will prompt you to log in and create a new project.
3. Once the setup is complete, Convex will generate a `.env.local` file with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`.

### 4. Authentication Setup (Clerk)

1. Create a project on [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).
2. Enable **Email** and/or **Social** authentication.
3. Obtain your API keys from the Clerk Dashboard.
4. Add the following keys to your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=https://your-clerk-domain.clerk.accounts.dev
```

### 5. Security Integration (Convex + Clerk)

In your `convex/auth.config.ts`, ensure the domain matches your `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN`:

```typescript
export default {
  providers: [
    {
      domain: process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN,
      applicationID: "convex",
    },
  ],
};
```

### 6. Running the Application

After setting up the environment variables, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
